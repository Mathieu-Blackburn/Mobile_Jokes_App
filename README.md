# Mobile_Jokes_App
An android app that fetches jokes from an API and displays them using a RecyclerView

**This was a solo school project focused mainly on learning. Not my cleanest nor best work, but it is fully fonctionnal.**

To run this project, you need to run it in Android Studio. It was made using the Pixel 2 screen specs in mind, but should still work on other kits.

This app features a login screen with a Username and Password, a register screen as well as a Change Password screen. They all work using internal storage.

When authenticated, the app goes to the specified API and fetches jokes as JSON. It then creates a RecyclerView using the data received.
